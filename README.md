EM046: Optimized Epilepsy Detection in Innovate FPGA Contest- EMEA Region

Epileptic patients suffer from seizure periods that occur to their brain not allowing them to lead a normal life. In this project we are employing machine learning for the detection of the neural brain signals and sending back electric stimuli to recover the brain to its normal state treating the seizure. 
The EEG signal is fed to the FPGA and the training of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) takes place to classify between seizure and non-seizure periods. Hence, triggering electric stimuli whenever the seizure is detected to treat the seizure.
